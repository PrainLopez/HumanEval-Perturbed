"When in doubt, ask the internet—it's a vast ocean of knowledge."
"Keep your code’s dependencies updated, or they’ll become outdated friends."
Use meaningful variable scopes to keep your code tidy.
"Remember, a good developer writes code that humans can read."
Avoid magic strings; let constants do the talking.
Use code snippets to save time and avoid reinventing the wheel.
"When your code is complex, add comments to clarify the chaos."
"Keep your code’s performance in check, but don’t chase every millisecond."
Use meaningful function signatures to communicate intent.
"Remember, a well-tested code is a happy code."
Avoid overusing global state unless you enjoy debugging mysteries.
Use meaningful class and method names for clarity.
"When your code is feeling sluggish, profile it for clues."
Keep your code’s architecture flexible for future adventures.
Use code formatting tools to keep your code looking sharp.
"Remember, good code is like good conversation—clear and engaging."
Avoid hardcoded secrets; use environment variables instead.
Use meaningful comments to tell future you what you were thinking.
"When debugging, isolate the problem like a detective on a case."
Keep your code’s logic straightforward and easy to follow.
Use version control branches to explore new ideas safely.
"Remember, a bug in time saves nine in debugging hours."
Avoid unnecessary complexity; simplicity is elegant.
Use code reviews to catch bugs and share knowledge.
"When your code is tangled, consider a gentle refactor massage."
"Keep your code’s dependencies in check, or chaos will ensue."
Use assertions to catch bugs early and often.
